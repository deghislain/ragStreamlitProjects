This small application is an illustration of RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation). It allows
end users to upload a pdf document. Once the document is uploaded, users can start questioning 
the document content with the help of AI.
Users can type their questions. A prompt is then generated and send to the AI. A response from the AI
is sent back to the user.
